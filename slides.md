# Paper
**Thatâ€™s a Tough Call: Studying the Challenges of Call Graph Construction for WebAssembly**
* Daniel Lehmann University of Stuttgart Stuttgart, Germany
* Frank Tip Northeastern University Boston, MA, USA
* Michelle Thalakottur Northeastern University Boston, MA, USA
* Michael Pradel University of Stuttgart Stuttgart, Germany

<!--
    Why are we interested
    * WASM becomes increasingly more important and is here to stay.
    * Call graph construction is a fundamental building block for many other static analysis.
    * Static analysis can be used for optimisation 
    * Static analysis can detect Security vulnerabilities
    * Can be used in reverse engineering and for code comprehension
    * Provides values on its own for example for Binary deploating

# Study Design

```ts
type Tool = "Wassail" | "WAVM" | "MetaDCE" | "Twiggy"
type Input = WebAssemblyBinary
type Output = { reachableFunc: SetReachableFunc, callGraph: CallGraph? }
type GroundTruth = func(input: Input): Output // Computed manually
type Generate = func(input: Input, tool: Tool): Output
type Results = { sound: boolean, precise: boolean }
type Compare = func(toolOutput: Output, groundTruth: Output): Results
```

---

# Example Workflow
```ts
const input: Input = "main.wasm"
const groudTruth: Output = getGroundTruth("main.wasm") // computed manually
const toolOutput: Output = generate("main.wasm", "Wassail")
const result: Results = compare(toolOutput, groudTruth)
```

---

# Input
`main.wat` or binary representation `main.wasm`
```wasm
(module
    (func $main (export "main")
        call $reachable
    )
    (func $reachable)
    (func $not-reachable)
)
```

---

# Compute Ground Truth
```wasm
(module
    (func $main (export "main")
        call $reachable
    )
    (func $reachable)
    (func $not-reachable)
)
```
=>
```ts
{
    reachableFunc: [ "main", "reachable" ],
    callGraph = "main -> reachable"
}
```

<style>
code {
    line-height: 1em;
}
</style>

---

# Ground Truth
```ts
{
    reachableFunc: [ "main", "reachable" ],
    callGraph: "main -> reachable"
}
```

This output is:
* **sound** - contains *all* reachable functions
* **precise** - contains *only* reachable functions

---

# Unsound
```wasm
(module
    (func $main (export "main")
        call $reachable
    )
    (func $reachable)
    (func $not-reachable)
)
```
=>
```ts
{
    reachableFunc: [ "main" ],
    callGraph: "main"
}
```

<style>
code {
    line-height: 1em;
}
</style>

---

# Imprecise
```wasm
(module
    (func $main (export "main")
        call $reachable
    )
    (func $reachable)
    (func $not-reachable)
)
```
=>
```ts
{
    reachableFunc: [ "main", "reachable", "not-reachable" ],
    callGraph: "main -> reachable, not-reachable"
}
```

<style>
code {
    line-height: 1em;
}
</style>

# Tools
* **Wassail**
Takes input `.wat` file and computes output call graph
* **WAVM+LLVM**
Lift the WASM binary to the intermediate representation LLVM IR and give that to the call graph generator WAVM
* **MetaDCE**
Takes input `.wasm` file and a list of entry points.
* **Twiggy**
Takes input `.wasm` file and computes dominator tree, from which one can extract the Reachable Function Set

---

# Example Workflow
```ts
const input: Input = "main.wasm"
const groudTruth: Output = getGroundTruth("main.wasm") // computed manually
const toolOutput: Output = generate("main.wasm", "Wassail")
const result: Results = compare(toolOutput, groudTruth)
```

* If our `toolOutput` does not contain all reachable functions as our `groundTruth` the output is unsound

* If our `toolOutput` does contain more reachable functions then our `groundTruth` then the output is imprecise

# A Second Example
```wasm

        i32.const 0
        call_indirect (param) (result)
    )
    (func $a)
    (func $b)
    (table $table 2 funcref)
    (elem $table (i32.const 0) $a $b)
)
```

### Precise call graph:
**main -> a**

# A Third Example

```wasm
(module
    (func $main (export "main")
        call $index
        i32.load
        call_indirect)
    (func $index (result i32) 
        i32.const 1337)
    (func $a)
    (func $not-reachable)
    (memory $memory 1)
    (data $memory (i32.const 1337)
        "\01\00\00\00")
    (table $table 2 funcref)
    (elem $table (i32.const 0)
        $not-reachable $a)
)
```

::right::

* One must model the memory
* One must track dataflow through functions

### Precise call graph:
**main -> index, main -> a**
### Set reachable functions:
**{ main, index, a }**

# It is getting difficult

```wasm

    i32.const 0
    call_indirect)
  (func $export1 (export "export1"))
  (func $export2 (export "export2"))
  (func $not-reachable)
  (table $table (export "table")
    1 funcref)
  (elem $table (i32.const 0) $export1)
)
```

::right::

```js
const binary = fs
  .readFileSync('./main.wasm');

const result = await WebAssembly
  .instantiate(binary, {});

const exp = result.instance.exports

exp.table.set(0, exp.export2);

exp.main();

# Challenges

There are a lot of challenges like the previous ones.\
Our paper identifies `12` challenges ordered into `6` classes.

* Program representation
* Indirect calls and table section
* Types
* Host environment
* Memory
* Source languages

<!--
1. Obtained by manually inspecting binaries
2. Running existing tools and then analysing why they crashed or were unsound for certain inputs
3. Going over WASM spec and checked for each section in the binary and each kind of instruction wether they could have an effect on call graph construction
=> gives no guarantee that no further challenges come up but confident that all Sections and instructions of WASM are considered
-->

# Prevalence in Real World Binaries
Measured on **8.392** binaries from the WasmBench dataset.

Of those binaries...
* 95% have no `.debug` section (*FunctionIndices*)
* 83% have at least one indirect call (*TableIndirection*)
* 92% have at least one imported function (*HostCallbacks*)
* 95% have at least one store instruction (*MemoryMutable*)

# Microbenchmarks

Our paper introduces a set of **24** microbenchmarks, crafted to reflect the WASM specific challenges.

### Example 1
Microbenchmark 1: **Simple direct call**
```wasm
(module
    (func $main (export "main")
        call $reachable
    )
    (func $reachable)
    (func $not-reachable)
)
```

::right::

* $F_{all}$: Set of all functions in the binary
* $F_{r}$: Set of reachable functions
* $F_{e}$: Set of call edges

### Ground Truth
$|F_{all}| = 3$, $|F_{r}| = 2$, $|F_{e}| = 1$
### Tool: Wassail
$|F_{r}| = 2$, $|F_{e}| = 1$, Sound, Precise
### Tool: Twiggy
$|F_{r}| = 2$, Sound, Precise

# Example 2
Microbenchmark 14:\
**Constant table index value**\
Related to challenges *TableIndexValue* and *TableIndirection*

```wasm
(module
    (func $main (export "main")
        i32.const 0
        call_indirect (param) (result)
    )
    (func $a)
    (func $b)
    (table $table 2 funcref)
    (elem $table (i32.const 0) $a $b)
)
```

::right::

### Ground Truth
$|F_{all}| = 3$, $|F_{r}| = 2$, $|F_{e}| = 1$
### Tool: Wassail
$|F_{r}| = 3$, $|F_{e}| = 2$, Sound, *Not* Precise
### Tool: WAVM+LLVM
$|F_{r}| = 1$, $|F_{e}| = 0$ *Not* Sound, *Not* Precise

<style>
code {
    line-height: 1em;
}
</style>

---

# Result

* None of the four evaluated tools: **Wassail**, **WAVM+LLVM**, **MetaDCE** and **Twiggy** is sound for all benchmarks.
* None of the tools is precise for all benchmarks.
* The approach **WAVM+LLVM** is unsound for most benchmarks, because lifting WASM to LLVM IR loses crutial information
* Some benchmarks cause the tools to crash
* Common case for imprecision is the challenge class **Indirect calls and table section**

---

# Implications

* Static analysis should likely be performed directly on WASM bytecode
* Future analysis should test against the microbenchmarks
* Future analyses should...
  * use types to constrain indirect call targets
  * track dataflow and memory
  * analyse host code to improve precision

# Evaluation on Real World Binaries
**10** real world binaries collected from NPM
* Ground Truth generation:
  * Exercise each binary with test cases
  * Collect set $F_{dyn}$ (all executed functions by the tests) through dynamic analysis
* Perfom static analysis on the binaries with our tools and report $F_r$
* Quantify unsoundness: $F_{unsound} = F_{dyn} - F_r$

---

# Result

* All tools but **MetaDCE** are unsound for at least one binary
* **MetaDCE** crashes on two binaries
* **Twiggy** and **MetaDCE** are more conservative in declaring functions as unreachable
* **WAVM+LLVM** is unsound for most binaries

---

# Summary

* First systematic study on challenges in call graph construction for WebAssembly
* How prevalent are those challenges in real world binaries
* How are they handled by existing static analysis
* All exisiting analysis approaches are unsound and imprecise
* Suggestion for future analysis:
  * Rely on WebAssembly bytecode instead of intermediate representation like LLVM IR
  * Take into account dataflow
  * Perform pointer analysis
